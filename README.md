(Best viewed on laptop and desktop devices)

React toy project where I re-created the landing page of <a href="http://commercebear.com/">CommerceBear</a> in order to compare and contrast the differences between popular JavaScript component frameworks React and Svelte.

## Features
- Tech and concepts used: 
    * Modern ES6
    * Create React App
    * CSS Modules
    * HTML5 and modern CSS3 properties (Flexbox, CSS Grids)

## Get Started

Clone the repository and ensure the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your machine.

Go into the project directory and install all dependecies. 

```bash
cd NAME-OF-PROJECT
npm install
```

To start the development server...

```bash
npm start
```

## To Do
(Improvements I would like to make if I had more time)

- Responsive design to make the page suitable for every screen width & device 
- Replace class components with function components using React Hooks
- Add CSS animations and style hover states to mirror the look of the main page more accurately
